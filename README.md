# Teacher Salary Trends & Equity Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores the relationship between state-level per-pupil spending and average teacher salaries over the last five years. The analysis combines cleaned and processed datasets in BigQuery, calculates correlations, and visualizes trends through an interactive dashboard in Looker Studio.

**Research Question:**  
What is the relationship between school district per-pupil spending and average teacher salaries over the last five years, and do districts with higher spending tend to pay teachers more?

**Objective:**  
To examine how education spending impacts teacher compensation across U.S. states and highlight trends that may inform education policy or administrative decisions.
